/**
 * Aggregate file changes across a single agent turn into one
 * reviewable changeset.
 *
 * Approach (cumulative-by-design):
 *   1. Walk the session's messages from the most recent user message
 *      forward, collecting every toolCall whose `name` is `write` or
 *      `edit`. Pair each with its `toolResult` via `toolCallId`.
 *   2. Extract the affected file path from the toolCall's `input.path`
 *      (the SDK schema for both tools).
 *   3. For each unique file, prefer `git diff HEAD -- <path>` so the
 *      output is the CUMULATIVE diff of all edits in the turn (and
 *      reflects prior tracked content, not just per-edit deltas).
 *      That lines up with what users actually want to review:
 *      "what's different from main now?", not "what was the agent's
 *      4th edit operation?".
 *   4. If the file is untracked OR the project has no `.git`, fall
 *      back to a pure-addition diff: read the current contents and
 *      emit `--- /dev/null` / `+++ b/<path>` / `+`-prefixed lines.
 *      Captures the full new file when the agent created it from
 *      scratch.
 *   5. If neither path works (file deleted, can't read, etc.), fall
 *      back to the SDK's per-edit `details.diff` from the LAST edit
 *      result for that file. Imperfect but better than nothing.
 *
 * Boundary: when the caller passes `startIndex` (the message-array
 * index captured at the most recent `agent_start` event by the session
 * registry), we walk from there exactly. Otherwise we approximate
 * "latest turn" as "since the most recent user message" — fine for
 * cold-loaded sessions that haven't yet emitted an `agent_start`.
